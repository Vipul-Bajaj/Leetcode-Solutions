<h1>Evaluate Division</h1>

<p>
You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values, where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i]. Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.
</p>
<p>
You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.
</p>
<p>
Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.
</p>
<p>
Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.
</p>

<b>Example 1:</b>

    Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
    Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
    Explanation: 
    Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
    queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
    return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
    
<b>Example 2:</b>

    Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0], queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
    Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
    
<b>Example 3:</b>

    Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5], queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
    Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]

<b>Constraints:</b>

- 1 <= equations.length <= 20
- equations[i].length == 2
- 1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5
- values.length == equations.length
- 0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0
- 1 <= queries.length <= 20
- queries[i].length == 2
- 1 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5
- Ai, Bi, Cj, Dj consist of lower case English letters and digits.

                ret = -1.0
            elif dividend == divisor:
