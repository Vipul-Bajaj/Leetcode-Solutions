<h1>Find the Difference</h1>

<p>
You are given two strings s and t.
<br>
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
<br>
Return the letter that was added to t.
</p>

<b>Example 1:</b>

    Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
    Output: "e"
    Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

<b>Example 2:</b>

    Input: s = "", t = "y"
    Output: "y"

<b>Example 3:</b>

    Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
    Output: "a"

<b>Example 4:</b>

    Input: s = "ae", t = "aea"
    Output: "a"
<b>Constraints:</b>

- 0 <= s.length <= 1000
- t.length == s.length + 1
- s and t consist of lower-case English letters.

<h2>Solution</h2>

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        ch = 0
        for c in s:
            ch^=ord(c)
        for c in t:
            ch^=ord(c)
        return chr(ch)
```
