<h1>Edit Distance</h1>

<p>
Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

</p>

<b>Example 1:</b>

    Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
    rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
    rose -> ros (remove 'e')
    
<b>Example 2:</b>

    Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: 
    intention -> inention (remove 't')
    inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
    enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
    exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
    exection -> execution (insert 'u')

<b>Constraints:</b>

- 0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
- word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.

<h2>Solution</h2>

```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        m = len(word1)
        n = len(word2)
        
        dp = [[0 for j in range(n+1)] for i in range(m+1)]
        
        for i in range(m+1):
            for j in range(n+1):
                if i == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = j
                elif j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = i
                elif word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1],dp[i-1][j-1])+1
        return dp[m][n]
```
