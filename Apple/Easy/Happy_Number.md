<h1>Happy Number</h1>

<p>
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

<b>Example 1:</b>

    Input: n = 19
    Output: true
    Explanation:
    1^2 + 9^2 = 82
    8^2 + 2^2 = 68
    6^2 + 8^2 = 100
    1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
    
<b>Example 2:</b>

    Input: n = 2
    Output: false

<b>Constraints:</b>

- 1 <= n <= 231 - 1

<h2>Solution</h2>

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        def get_next(n):
            total_sum = 0
            while n > 0:
                n, digit = divmod(n, 10)
                total_sum += digit ** 2
            return total_sum

        seen = set()
        while n != 1 and n not in seen:
            seen.add(n)
            n = get_next(n)

        return n == 1
```
